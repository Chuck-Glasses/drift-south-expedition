Field science &amp; outreach materials for the Drift South Expedition (Fall 2025)

## What Is Drift South?
Drift South Expedition is a one-way, continuous journey from the Headwaters of the Mississippi to the Gulf via the Atchafalaya
River. Along the way, we’re:

- Collecting **low-cost, repeatable scientific data** every 10–20 miles
- Supporting **partner labs** with grab samples, drift nets, and visual observations
- Logging **trash accumulation**, **leaf litter**, **shoreline erosion**, and **outflows**
- Amplifying **regional voices**, Indigenous perspectives, and river-based equity work
- Contributing to **policy, resilience, and water access** efforts across the basin

## Core Sections

- [`/protocols/`](./protocols): Field-tested sampling steps for all base and partner data
- [`/contacts/`](./contacts): Researchers, educators, and partners connected to DSE
- [`/data/`](./data): Raw & processed environmental data (to be uploaded post-expedition)
- [`/outreach/`](./outreach): Media plans, sample emails, and story-building tools
- [`/planning/`](./planning): Route breakdowns, KML files, and documentation

## Who This Is For

- Scientists seeking river-wide data or sampling support
- Educators creating open-source STEM resources
- Advocates working on clean water and resilience
- River lovers, paddlers, and change-makers of all stripes
